# Docker Security Implementation

## Security Measures Applied

### 1. Base Image Security

- **Current**: Using `node:20-slim` (Debian-based)
- **Rationale**: More frequent security updates than Alpine
- **Note**: Base image vulnerabilities are monitored and addressed through regular updates

### 2. Multi-Stage Build

- **Builder Stage**: Contains development dependencies and build tools
- **Production Stage**: Minimal runtime environment
- **Benefit**: Reduces attack surface by excluding development tools

### 3. Non-Root User

- **User**: `nextjs` (UID: 1001)
- **Group**: `nodejs` (GID: 1001)
- **Benefit**: Prevents privilege escalation attacks

### 4. Package Manager Removal

- Removes git, build-essential, python3 from production image
- Reduces attack surface and image size
- Only runtime dependencies remain

### 5. File Permissions

- Proper ownership settings for application files
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Minimal writable directories

### 6. .dockerignore

- Excludes development files, secrets, and unnecessary content
- Reduces build context and potential information leakage

## Security Recommendations

### Runtime Security

1. **Container Scanning**: Regularly scan images with tools like Trivy
2. **Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits in production
3. **Read-Only Root**: Run containers with read-only root filesystem
4. **Network Policies**: Implement proper network segmentation

### Example Production Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
services:
  app:
    image: your-app:latest
    read_only: true
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: "0.5"
```

### Monitoring

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scans in CI/CD
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: Container behavior analysis
3. **Log Analysis**: Security event monitoring

## Known Issues

- Base image may contain vulnerabilities that are patched upstream
- Regular image updates recommended
- Consider distroless images for even better security
